Farmerbot is a service that a farmer can run allowing him to automatically manage the nodes of his farm.

## How to start farmerbot

- Make sure to start redis server, and get redis DB address for example: <localhost:6379>

```bash
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

- Create a new json file `config.json` and add your farm, nodes and power configurations:

```json
{
    "farm": {
        "id": "<your farm ID>"
    },
    "nodes": [{
        "id": "<your node ID>",
        "twinID": "<your node twin ID>",
        "resources": {
            "total": {
                "SRU": "<enter total sru>",
                "MRU": "<enter total mru>",
                "HRU": "<enter total hru>",
                "CRU": "<enter total cru>"
            }
        }
    }],
    "power": {
        "periodicWakeUp": "08:30AM",
        "wakeUpThreshold": 80
    }
}
```

sudo cp farmerbot /usr/local/bin
farmerbot -c config.json -m <mnemonics> -n dev -r <redis address> -d false -l farmerbot.log
```

Where:

- `-c config.json` is the json file of farmerbot configurations, with a default `config.json`.
- `-m <mnemonics>` is your farm mnemonics.
- `-n dev` is your network and can be main, qa and test with a default `dev`.
- `-r <redis address>` is your redis DB address.
- `-d false` is the value of debug mode with a default `false`.
- `-l farmerbot.log` is log file to include logs generated by farmerbot with a default `farmerbot.log`.

> Note: **`30 minutes`** are set for a timeout node power change
