# How to use configure power command

- Get your redis DB address used in farmerbot
- Create a new json file `config.json` and add your node options configurations:

```json
{
    "wakeUpThreshold": "<the threshold for resources usage that will need another node to be on, default is 80, optional>",
    "periodicWakeUp": "<daily time to wake up nodes for your farm, default is the time your run the command, format is 00:00AM or 00:00PM, optional>",
}
```

- Run:

```bash
farmerbot powermanager configure -c config.json -m <mnemonics> -n dev -r <redis address> -d false -l farmerbot.log
```

Where:

- `-c config.json` is the json file of farmerbot configurations, with a default `config.json`.
- `-m <mnemonics>` is your farm mnemonics.
- `-n dev` is your network and can be main, qa and test with a default `dev`.
- `-r <redis address>` is your redis DB address.
- `-d false` is the value of debug mode with a default `false`.
- `-l farmerbot.log` is log file to include logs generated by farmerbot.
